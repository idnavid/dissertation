This study investigates various aspects of multi-speaker interference and its impact on speaker recognition. 
Single-channel multi-speaker speech signals, otherwise known as co-channel speech, comprise a significant portion of data used in speech processing. 
Examples of co-channel signals are recordings from meetings, conversations, debates, etc. 
The nuisances of co-channel speech in speech processing are two-fold: 1) simultaneous speech (i.e. overlapped speech), 2) non-overlapping speaker interference. 
In the case of overlap, the direct effects of two stochastically similar, non-stationary signals added together can disrupt speech processing performance. 
For example, in speaker recognition, identifying target speakers in overlapped segments is substantially more difficult compared to single-speaker signals. 
Analyses in this study show that introducing overlapped speech can increase speaker recognition error rates by an order of magnitude. 
In addition to the direct impact of overlap, its secondary effect is in how one speaker forces the other to change his/her speech characteristics. 
These changes in speech characteristics include modified volume, fundamental frequency, speech rate, etc. 
The mere presence of secondary speakers in a signal is a significant source of error for speaker recognition. 
Secondary speech reduces the reliability of speaker-dependent statistical models and also confuses the recognition system when faced with a co-channel audio signal, since different segments of audio belongs to different speakers. 

This study investigates different forms of co-channel data. 
In scenarios where the focus is primarily on overlap, independent cross-talk is used. 
Independent cross-talk refers to the summation of two independent audio signals from different speakers to simulate overlapped data. 
The alternative form of data used in this study is real conversation recordings. 
Although conversations contain both overlapped and non-overlapped speech, independent cross-talk is a better source to target overlaps. 
The reason real conversations are not deemed sufficient for overlap analysis is the scarcity of overlaps in typical conversations. 
Independent cross-talk is obtained from the GRID corpus. GRID was used in the speech separation challenge as a source of overlapped speech. 
Real conversations are obtained from the Switchboard telephone conversation corpus. 
Other real conversational data used throughout this study include: the AMI meeting corpus, Prof-life-log, and UTDrive data. 
These datasets provide a perspective towards real environment noise and co-channel interference in day-to-day speech. 

Categorizing datasets allows for a separate and meticulous analysis of different aspects of co-channel speech. 
Most of the focus in analyzing overlaps is presented in the form of overlap detection techniques. 
This study proposes two overlap detection methods: 1) Pyknogram-based 2) Gammatone sub-band frequency modulation (GSFM). 
Both methods take advantage of the harmonic structure of speech to detect overlaps. 
Pyknograms do so by enhancing speech harmonics and evaluating dynamics across time, while GSFM magnifies the presence of multiple harmonics in different sub-bands. 
The other advancements proposed in this study use back-end modeling techniques to compensate co-channel speech in real conversational data. 
These techniques are presented to reduce the impact of interfering speech in speaker-dependent models. 
Several methods are investigated, all of which propose a different modification to the popular probabilistic linear discriminant analysis used in state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems. 
In addition to model compensation techniques, this study presents CRSS-SpkrDiar, which is a speaker diarization research platform aimed at tackling conversational co-channel speech data. 
CRSS-SpkrDiar was developed during the course of this study and alleviates end-to-end co-channel speech analysis. 

The main contribution of this study is in distinguishing overlap from co-channel speech. 
The majority of existing co-channel speech research considers overlap and co-channel to be synonymous. 
Here it is pointed out that such a simplification of the problem limits prospects. 
In addition to proposing different overlap detection methods, this study introduces novel techniques to deal with the more general case of co-channel speech.
