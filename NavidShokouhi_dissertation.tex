% Optional: If you want to use Times as your font, load it here.  Note that
% although package "times" should work, it may not be the best choice.  Newer
% LaTeX distributions offer "mathptmx" and "newtxtext,newtxmath" as superior
% replacements.  You should find out which is best for your LaTeX.  (If this
% sounds confusing, you probably shouldn't use Times at all.)
%\usepackage{times}

% Optional: If your LaTeX has microtype, use it to improve text quality:
\usepackage{microtype}

% Recommended: If your thesis contains math, use the AMS packages:
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}
%
% Recommended: If your thesis needs to import graphics, use graphicx:
\usepackage{graphicx}

% Recommended: If your bibliography contains web page URLs, the url package
% improves their appearance (e.g., better line breaking):
\usepackage{url}

% Required: To satisfy UTD's formatting requirements for citations, use the
% "natbib" package.  (Use other citation packages at your own risk; not all
% are flexible enough to meet UTD's requirements.)  If you wish to use numeric
% citations, change "authoryear" to "numbers" below.  Use the "chicago" BibTeX
% style, which most closely matches the Turabian formatting required by UTD.
% UTD mandates a blank line between each pair of bibliography entries, so set
% \bibsep as shown below.  Finally, if you are accustomed to using \cite as
% your citation macro, point it to natbib's \citep macro as shown.
\usepackage[authoryear]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{chicago}
\setlength{\bibsep}{12pt plus 1pt minus 1pt}
\let\cite=\citep

% Required: If you have any wide tables or figures that need to be typeset
% in landscape, use the rotating package:
\usepackage{rotating}
%
% Optional: If you use hyperref to auto-generate hyperlinks, always load it
% LAST since it modifies everything else.  In addition, only load hyperref if
% you use pdftex or pdflatex to generate PDFs directly.  Do NOT use it if you
% use plain tex or latex to generate a DVI file.  (If you are generating DVI
% files which you then convert to PDF, you should seriously consider switching
% to pdflatex.  The DVI format loses information because it cannot support
% modern PDF document features.  Using pdflatex to generate PDFs directly
% therefore results in PDFs of significantly higher quality.)

\begin{abstract}
This mock dissertation concerns the development and usage of a \LaTeX{}
class file that eases the task of creating UTD theses and dissertations.
The class file automatically creates margins, page headers and footers, page
numbers, paragraph parameters, title pages, and table/figure captions
consistent with the guidelines set forth by the UTD graduate school.
In contrast to many prior works, care has been taken to respect relevant
\LaTeX{} coding conventions and standards.
This helps to maximize compatibility with other \LaTeX{} packages, and
eases the incorporation of existing publication texts into a dissertation
master document.

The rest of the sample dissertation proceeds as follows:
Chapter~\ref{c:usage} details the proper usage of macros provided by the
class file.
Chapter~\ref{c:conclude} concludes the sample dissertation.
The \hyperref[a:other]{appendix} demonstrates the formatting of an appendix
(optional).
